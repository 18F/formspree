<p>Thanks for using {{config.SERVICE_NAME}}. Congrats, you're one step away from making forms on {{host}} functional.</p>

<p>All you have to do is click the link below to confirm your email. To prevent spamming, you'll have to repeat this step for every page where you insert your form. Note that you won't be receiving any emails from the site before you confirm your email.</p>

{% if data and keys %}
    <div style="padding: 9px; border: 1px solid #359173;">
        <small>In case it wasn't yourself the one who submitted this, here are the contents of the form:</small>

        <table border="0" width="100%" style="font-size: 11px;">
            {% for k in keys %}
                <tr>
                    <td align="right" valign="top" width="70"><strong>{{k}}:</strong> </td>
                    <td align="left" valign="top" width="*">
                      <pre style="margin: 0; font-family: inherit;">{{data.get(k,'')}}</pre>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            {% endfor %}
        </table>
    </div>
{% endif %}

<p><strong>Why did I receive this email?</strong><br />
Someone (hopefully you?) used your email with the {{config.SERVICE_NAME}} API on {{host}}. If this wasn't you, no worries. This is the only email you'll get.</p>
